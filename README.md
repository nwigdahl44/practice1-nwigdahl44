When I'm at a party and I tell someone that I do math they typically are like, "gross, why." This inevitably leads me to attempt to explain, often ineffectively, why math is actually really cool and they just got taught it wrong.

This past month was mostly break. I drive the bus for Cyride, so I did some of that. I also played a lot of Total War Warhammer 2.

I organize my work primarily using Trello and the Getting Things Done framework. I keep all my projects and tasks on little cards on my Trello Boards, and have systems in place to prioritize and complete them. Other than that, I try to keep all my files and documents for each of my classes stored in Dropbox so I can easily access them wherever I'm at.
